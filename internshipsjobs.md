We currently have the following internships available:


## Internship #1: Improve the Knowledge base of MONARC, a risk assessment tool

CASES is one of the main actors of cyber security in Luxembourg and is a young and motivated team with expertise in the field of information security. CASES has developed an optimised risk analysis tool and method: MONARC (Optimised Risk Analysis Method), allowing for a precise and repeatable risk management. Additional research in risk models, assets and scenarios are essential for an optimised risk assessment.

#### Job:

* Extend the database contents of MONARC (monarc.lu) by mapping the risks available in the DB with controls of different security frameworks ("referentials"), like NIST, COBIT, etc.
* Create a generic risk model for CERTs,
* Create new objects in MONARC according to the needs of users, required for new technologies, etc.

#### Requirement:

* Knowledge in risk analysis,
* Knowledge in existing security frameworks ("referentials") is considered a plus,
* Able to work in Luxembourg and from home,
* Strong motivation.

#### Apply:

## Internship #3: Toolset to improve Privacy and Data Protection

CASES is one of the main actors of cyber security in Luxembourg and is a young and motivated team with expertise in the field of information security and privacy. CASES has developed an optimised risk analysis tool and method: MONARC (Optimised Risk Analysis Method), allowing for a precise and repeatable risk management approach, assessing both information security and privacy for an organisation.

#### Job:

Examine the state of practice as well as the existing GDPR fines in Europe, and develop or integrate a set of tools that address the most stringent needs, such as:

* Assessing and mitigating privacy risks using MONARC,
* Evaluation of open source tools that enable data protection throughout the data lifecycle,
* Creating/integration open-source tools for managing GDPR-specific processes (e.g., data breaches, data discovery, data deletion),
* (Automatic) generation of basic data protection procedures and guidelines for privacy by design and security by design,
* Evaluation of practical privacy-enhancing technologies (PET).

A selection of two or more of the topics above can be extended into an MSc thesis.

#### Requirement:

* Having read the full GDPR and knowledge of related EDPB guidelines,
* Knowledge of risk assessments and of PETs is considered a plus,
* Strong interest in data protection and privacy,
* Development of dashboards and knowledge of scripting is considered a plus,
* Able to work in Luxembourg and from home,
* Strong motivation to learn and work as part of the team.

## Internship #4: Security Assessment in line with the CSA Act

CASES is one of the main actors of cyber security in Luxembourg and is a young and motivated team with expertise in the field of information security. CASES has developed an optimised risk analysis tool and method: MONARC (Optimised Risk Analysis Method), allowing for a precise and repeatable risk management. This risk management is crucial for being able to mitigate risks in view of the certification in line with the incoming EU-Cybersecurity Act (CSA) that entered into force in July 2019.

#### Job:

* Analysis of existing standards (in particular but not limited to ETSI EN 303 645 and IMDA IoT Cyber Security Guide) in order to elicit basic-level security domains and requirements in line with the CSA requirements,
* Creation of a questionnaire and recommendation list on the basis of the domains and requirements identified above,
* Creation of a MONARC-specific risk template to support the CSA domains/risks identified above.

These three topics together can be potentially extended into an MSc thesis (subject to further adaptation).

#### Requirement:

* Having read the EU-CSA act,
* Knowledge in Information Risk Analysis is considered a plus,
* Able to work in Luxembourg and from home,
* Strong motivation to learn and work as part of the team.

#### Apply:

## Internship #5: MONARC Multi-Language Support and New Visualisations

CASES is one of the main actors of cyber security in Luxembourg and is a young and motivated team with expertise in the field of information security. CASES has developed an optimised risk analysis tool and method: MONARC (Optimised Risk Analysis Method), allowing for a precise and repeatable risk management. With more international users employing MONARC in their day to day work, MONARC needs to support more languages than it does already; also, a requested addition is to have a visualisation that indicates the progress in the implementation of new features in a related .

#### Job:

* Adding support for more languages (without necessarily having to do the actual translation) in the MONARC frontend and backend,
* Adding one or more visualisations to indicate advancement in the implementation of new features,
* Helping improve existing dashboards in MONARC,
* Updating the documentation relative to the new implemented features.

#### Requirement:

* Knowledge in Python, PHP, JavaScript, Git, Laminas framework,
* Knowledge/skills in data visualisation,
* Knowledge in Information Risk Analysis is considered a plus,
