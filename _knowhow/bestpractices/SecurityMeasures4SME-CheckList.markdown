<h3 class="titre-page">Risk Management and Security Policy</h3>
**[Risk management]({{site.url}}/knowhow/glossary/RiskProcessing.html)** requires analysis of the security requirement for each [asset]({% link _knowhow/glossary/Assets.markdown %}) (**[classification]({{site.url}}/knowhow/cisoapproach/SecurityPolicy-Classification.html)** according to the feared **impact**), assesses the likelihood of threats for these assets and quantifies the ease with which the vulnerabilities of these assets can be exploited.

For very small businesses, this risk analysis is not easy to perform. As a result, this section provides a non-exhaustive list of potential threats and responses to reduce their impact.

If your organisation fears serious impacts, it is strongly recommended that you proceed with a risk management approach and that you define a **[security policy]({{site.url}}/knowhow/glossary/SecurityCharter.html)** and a continuous improvement process. More advice can be found in the article "[Protecting Your Business]({{site.url}}/publications/ProtectingYourCompany.html)".

<h3 class="titre-page">Threats to infrastructure</h3>
Infrastructure includes all the essential assets and services on which the information system is based, such as the supply of power, communication or processing services. These services are therefore critical to the operation of the information system and exposed to certain threats (see "[Threats to infrastructure]({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Infrastructure.html)":

* [Fire]({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Infrastructure.html#fire)
* [Service interruption]({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Infrastructure.html#service-interruption)
* [Denial of service attacks and distributed denial of service attacks]({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Infrastructure.html#denial-of-servicedistributed-service)
* [Disrupted transmission of wireless communications]({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Infrastructure.html#disrupted-transmission-of-wireless-communications)

<h3 class="titre-page">Threats to hardware</h3>
See the article "[Threats to hardware]({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Hardware.html)":

* [Unusable backups]({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Hardware.html#unusable-backups)

<h3 class="titre-page">Threats to software</h3>
Software is the most commonly used user interface for manipulating information. This interface, which offers a finite but immense set of possibilities, is subject to multiple constraints and multiple threats jeopardising the operation of the organisation, the most acute being malware, which will be addressed in a specific chapter in this document. See "[Threats to software]({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Software.html)":

* [Unsuitable software environment]({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Software.html#unsuitable-software-environment)
* [Use of unapproved software]({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Software.html#use-of-unapproved-software)
* [Administration impossible]({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Software.html#unavailability-of-administrators)

<h3 class="titre-page">Legal aspects</h3>
Special legal and regulatory provisions must be adhered to by organisations. These provisions involve, in particular, respect for privacy, copyright and the specific regulatory provisions of the industrial sector. See "[Legal aspects]({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-LegalAspects.html)":

* [Unauthorised processing of personal data â€“ Employee monitoring]({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-LegalAspects.html#unauthorised-processing-of-personal-data--employee-monitoring)

* [Regulatory requirements]({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-LegalAspects.html#regulatory-requirements)

<h3 class="titre-page">Threats to people</h3>
See the article "[Threats to people]({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2HR.html)":

* [Social engineering/Inadequate communication]({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2HR.html#manipulation-of-people)
* [Human error]({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2HR.html#human-error-prevention-measures)
