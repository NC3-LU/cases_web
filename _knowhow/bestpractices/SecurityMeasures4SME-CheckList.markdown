## Risk Management and Security Policy
**[Risk management]({% link _knowhow/glossary/RiskProcessing.markdown %})** requires analysis of the security requirement for each [asset]({% link _knowhow/glossary/Assets.markdown %}) (**[classification]({% link _knowhow/cisoapproach/SecurityPolicy-Classification.markdown %})** according to the feared **[impact]({% link _knowhow/glossary/Impact.markdown %})**), assesses the likelihood of threats for these assets, and quantifies the ease with which the vulnerabilities of these assets can be exploited.

For very small businesses, this risk analysis is not easy to perform. As a result, this section provides a non-exhaustive list of potential threats and responses to reduce their impact.

If your organisation fears serious impacts, it is strongly recommended that you proceed with a risk management approach and define a **[security policy]({% link _knowhow/glossary/SecurityCharter.markdown %})** and a continuous improvement process. More advice can be found in the article '[Protecting Your Business]({% link _publications/ProtectingYourCompany.markdown %})'.

## Threats to Infrastructure
Infrastructure includes all the essential assets and services on which the information system is based, such as the supply of power, communication or processing services. These services are critical to the operation of the information system and exposed to certain threats (see '[Threats to infrastructure]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Infrastructure.markdown %})'):

* [Fire]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Infrastructure.markdown %}#fire)
* [Service interruption]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Infrastructure.markdown %}#service-interruption)
* [Denial of service attacks and distributed denial of service attacks]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Infrastructure.markdown %}#denial-of-servicedistributed-service)
* [Disrupted transmission of wireless communications]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Infrastructure.markdown %}#disrupted-transmission-of-wireless-communications)
* [Wireless network tapping]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Infrastructure.markdown %}#wireless-network-tapping)
* [Interception of communications]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Infrastructure.markdown %}#interception-of-communications)
* [Network access unavailable]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Infrastructure.markdown %}#network-unavailability)
* [Power cut]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Infrastructure.markdown %}#power-cut)
* [Discontinuity of service providers]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Infrastructure.markdown %}#discontinuity-of-service-providers)
* [Infiltrating the premises]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Infrastructure.markdown %}#infiltrating-the-premises)

## Threats to Hardware
See the article '[Threats to hardware]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Hardware.markdown %})':

* [Unusable backups]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Hardware.markdown %}#unusable-backups)
* [Hardware damaged during transport]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Hardware.markdown %}#hardware-damaged-during-transport)
* [Failure of IT or communications equipment]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Hardware.markdown %}#failure-of-it-or-communications-equipment)
* [Insertion or removal of hardware]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Hardware.markdown %}#addition-or-removal-of-hardware)
* [Device recovery]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Hardware.markdown %}#device-recovery)
* [Aggravated theft]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Hardware.markdown %}#aggravated-theft)

## Threats to Software
Software is the most commonly used user interface for manipulating information. This interface, which offers a finite but immense set of possibilities, is subject to multiple constraints and multiple threats jeopardising the operation of the organisation, the most acute being malware, which will be addressed in a specific chapter in this document. See '[Threats to software]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Software.markdown %})':

* [Unsuitable software environment]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Software.markdown %}#unsuitable-software-environment)
* [Use of unapproved software]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Software.markdown %}#use-of-unapproved-software)
* [Administration impossible]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Software.markdown %}#unavailability-of-administrators)

## Legal Aspects
Special legal and regulatory provisions must be adhered to by organisations. These provisions involve, in particular, respect for privacy, copyright and the specific regulatory provisions of the industrial sector. See '[Legal aspects]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-LegalAspects.markdown %})':

* [Unauthorised processing of personal data â€“ Employee monitoring]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-LegalAspects.markdown %}#unauthorised-processing-of-personal-data--employee-monitoring)
* [Invalid or non-existent licence]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-LegalAspects.markdown %}#invalid-or-non-existent-licence)
* [Lack of traceability of operations]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-LegalAspects.markdown %}#lack-of-traceability-of-operations)
* [Regulatory requirements]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-LegalAspects.markdown %}#regulatory-requirements)

## Threats to People
See the article '[Threats to people]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2HR.markdown %})':

* [Social engineering/Inadequate communication]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2HR.markdown %}#manipulation-of-people)
* [Human error]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2HR.markdown %}#human-error-prevention-measures)
* [Misuse of the organisation's resources]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2HR.markdown %}#misuse-of-it-resources)
* [Absent staff]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2HR.markdown %}#staff-absences)
* [Malicious administrator]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2HR.markdown %}#the-administrator)
* [Spam / Phishing]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2HR.markdown %}#spam--phishing)
* [Third-party use of access reserved for a single user]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2HR.markdown %}#use-of-limited-access-by-a-third-party)
