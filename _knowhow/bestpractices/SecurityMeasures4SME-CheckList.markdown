<h3 class="titre-page">Risk Management and Security Policy</h3>
**Risk management** requires analysis of the security requirement for each asset (**classification** according to the feared **impact**), assesses the likelihood of threats for these assets and quantifies the ease with which the vulnerabilities of these assets can be exploited.

For very small businesses, this risk analysis is not easy to perform. As a result, this section provides a non-exhaustive list of potential threats and responses to reduce their impact.

If your organisation fears serious impacts, it is strongly recommended that you proceed with a risk management approach and that you define a **security policy** and a continuous improvement process. More advice can be found in the article "Protecting Your Business".

Software is the most commonly used user interface for manipulating information. This interface, which offers a finite but immense set of possibilities, is subject to multiple constraints and multiple threats jeopardising the operation of the organisation, the most acute being malware, which will be addressed in a specific chapter in this document.
