Software is the user interface most commonly used by hackers who wish to manipulate data. It is subject to a number of restrictions and [threats]({% link _knowhow/glossary/Threat.markdown %}) which may place an organisation’s operation in jeopardy. This section is specifically dedicated to malicious software (or ‘malware’).

## Unsuitable software environment
In order to run correctly and fulfil its roles, IT hardware must have the appropriate software. To do so involves:

* making a list of the software needed for the company to operate, as well as any software dependency (library of functions). (Draft and enforce a Sectoral policy on the [Classification and control of resources]({% link _knowhow/cisoapproach/SecurityPolicy-ClassificationAndControlOfResources.markdown %})).
* establishing configuration types for software equipment.
* backing up the necessary software (and updates) in a digital library available upon installation.
* managing software licences. (Draft and enforce a Sectoral policy on Compliance – [Intellectual property]({% link _knowhow/cisoapproach/SecurityPolicy-Compliance.markdown %}#intellectual-property)).

## Use of unapproved software
The use of unapproved software may lead to the infringement of rights related to this software or to the introduction of computerised processing that may prejudice the company. It is therefore important to ensure that the company’s IT environment is not disrupted by software that is unsuitable, by which we mean unauthorised to attain the organisation’s objectives. It is important to ensure that:

* users respect the Charter for the use of IT resources.
* the software usage policy is restrictive and defined at operating system level (in other words, that a white list of executable applications has been drawn up). (Draft and enforce a Sectoral policy on the Organisation of security – [Authorisation procedure for the addition of tools]({% link _knowhow/cisoapproach/SecurityPolicy-OrganisationOfSecurity.markdown %}#authorising-the-addition-of-tools)).
* user accounts do not automatically have administrator permissions. (Draft and enforce a Sectoral policy on Access control – [Access control policy]({% link _knowhow/cisoapproach/SecurityPolicy-AccessControl.markdown %}#access-control-policy) and [Access rights management]({% link _knowhow/cisoapproach/SecurityPolicy-AccessControl.markdown %}#access-rights-management)).

## Unavailability of administrators
Administration of a computerised resource (hardware and/or software) allows you to react to events related to its environment and to adapt the system accordingly. It is therefore important to ensure that the resource is operable, in particular for solutions provided by third parties, especially those where a single supplier is the only one with knowledge of the administration procedure. Make sure you:

* an administrator is accessible and available at all times. (Draft and enforce a Sectoral policy on the Organisation of security – [Attribution of responsibilities]({% link _knowhow/cisoapproach/SecurityPolicy-OrganisationOfSecurity.markdown %}#attribution-of-responsibilities)).
* an administration procedure has been made available by the service provider. (Draft and enforce a Sectoral policy on Physical and environmental security – [Maintenance]({% link _knowhow/cisoapproach/SecurityPolicy-PhysicalAndEnvironmentalSecurity.markdown %}#maintenance)).
* trustworthy administrators have been recruited. (Draft and enforce a Sectoral policy on Human factors – [Security as a mission]({% link _knowhow/cisoapproach/SecurityPolicy-HumanFactors.markdown %}#security-as-a-mission)).
* training is given to the administrators. (Draft and enforce a Sectoral policy on Human factors – [Training and information]({% link _knowhow/cisoapproach/SecurityPolicy-HumanFactors.markdown %}#training-and-information)).
