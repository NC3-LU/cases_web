<h3 class="titre-page">Physical security perimeter</h3>
[Physical security]({{site.url}}knowhow/glossary/Physicalecurity.html) relating to the organisation is the first security aspect to be implemented. What would be the point of setting up password protection and sophisticated software if anyone could physically access an essential resource to steal, modify or destroy it? (SMEs see: [Infiltrating the premises]({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Infrastructure.html#infiltrating-the-premises) and [Insertion or removal of hardware]({{site.url}}/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Hardware.html#addition-or-removal-of-hardware) and [Device recovery]({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Hardware.html#device-recovery) and [Aggravated theft]({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Hardware.html#aggravated-theft)).

Always be aware of the actual value of a resource (see [classification]({{site.url}}/knowhow/cisoapproach/SecurityPolicy-Classification.html)) in order to be able to plan suitable protection.

All the elements listed as important or vital for “the organisation” must be installed in secure premises. These premises constitute the security perimeter.

<h3 class="titre-page">Rules within the perimeter</h3>

### The premises within the security perimeter should be:

* protected against access by unauthorised persons, and therefore especially by persons not from “the organisation”. (SMEs see: [Infiltrating the premises]({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Infrastructure.html#infiltrating-the-premises) and [Insertion or removal of hardware]({{site.url}}) and [Device recovery]({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Hardware.html#device-recovery) and [Aggravated theft]({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Hardware.html#aggravated-theft)). Access should be through a single door and authorised by the IT manager,
* protected against fire. The doors should be fire doors and fire alarms should be fitted. (SMEs see: [Fire]({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Infrastructure.html#fire))

### The following rules should also be respected:

* keys should under no circumstances be accessible to the public.
* office equipment such as fax machines and photocopiers should be located within a safe area, but not near more crucial elements, so as not to increase the need for people to access the area for more crucial elements,
* doors and windows should be kept locked, especially outside office hours,
* access points, especially on the ground floor, should be protected against unwanted entry, either by grills or by an electronic detection system paired with an audio alarm,
* hazardous or dangerously flammable materials (including cardboard, paper, waste baskets and cleaning products) should not be stored near vital or important elements.

### Technical measures
Physical security

<h3 class="titre-page">Electrical equipment safety</h3>
The electricity power supply for vital equipment must be made safe:

* by a power supply for 2 different sources (2 fuses on 2 circuits) where equipment has 2 power supplies (SMEs: see [Service interruption]({{site.url}}/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Infrastructure.html#service-interruption) and [Power cut]({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Infrastructure.html#power-cut) and [Discontinuity of service providers]({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Infrastructure.html#discontinuity-of-service-providers));
* by an uninterrupted power unit which ensures a supply of electricity during brief power cuts for a sufficient length of time to fully power off the equipment;
* by a backup generator.

[Physical security]({% link _knowhow/cisoapproach/SecurityPolicy-PhysicalAndEnvironmentalSecurity.markdown %})

<h3 class="titre-page">Maintenance</h3>
For resources classified as important or vital, a maintenance agreement with a guaranteed intervention or replacement period should be signed, compatible with the resource availability requirements. (SMEs: see [Invalid or non-existent licence]({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-LegalAspects.html#invalid-or-non-existent-licence) and [Administration impossible}({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Software.html#unavailability-of-administrators)). Maintenance is an important criterion in optimising the [availability]({% link _knowhow/glossary/Availability.markdown %}) of [resources]({% link _knowhow/glossary/Assets.markdown %})

When a piece of equipment leaves “the organisation” for maintenance, or when [it is discarded]({% link _knowhow/glossary/Discarded.markdown %}), it should not contain confidential data. If it does contain confidential data, a specific procedure should be decided upon (processing in-house, someone goes with the equipment, destruction of the hardware, etc.) based on the sensitivity of the data in question. (SMEs: see [Hardware damaged during transport]({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Hardware.html#hardware-damaged-during-transport) and [Device recovery]({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Hardware.html#device-recovery))

<h3 class="titre-page">Off-site equipment security</h3>
The equipment used for processing information off the site of “the organisation” (at home, in a hotel, at a client's) such as laptops or telephone, is subject to similar security procedures. However, users should be particularly attentive to the risk of theft and keep the hardware in their sight at all times. A specific insurance policy should be taken out for this type of equipment. Hardware should be marked, to prevent it being swapped. Authorisation must be granted by the head of equipment in “the organisation” before any hardware leaves the premises. This person may or may not provide for the use of data encryption tools on the hard disk. (SMEs: see [Hardware damaged during transport]({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Hardware.html#hardware-damaged-during-transport); [Aggravated theft]({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Hardware.html#aggravated-theft); [Basic security measures for laptop computers]({{site.url}}/publications/recommendationsecuring/SecuringLaptops.html#recommendations))

<h3 class="titre-page">Disposal and reuse of equipment</h3>
Any equipment that [is discarded]({% link _knowhow/glossary/Discarded.markdown %}) or reused in another context must have all its data removed; the disks should be wiped. The system can be reinstalled, where necessary. Depending on the sensitivity of the data saved on disk, the physical destruction of disks (in a crusher or a degausser) should be envisaged. (SMEs: see [Device recovery]({{site.url}}/knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Hardware.html#device-recovery)).

Traditional file deletion is not enough, as data will remain present on the disk. If in-house capabilities are not sufficient to do this, an external supplier can be entrusted with the task, under the careful monitoring of a member of the organisation.

Whichever method is chosen, please be respectful of the environment.

<h3 class="titre-page">Tidy office policy</h3>
Follow a tidy office policy, i.e.:

* tidy away papers and [removable data storage media]({{site.url}}/knowhow/glossary/RemovableDevices.html) (CD-ROMs, disks, etc), keeping them out of sight. Remove your documents from the printer, fax or photocopiers;
* keep the most important media under lock and key, or even in a fireproof safe;
* if anyone leaves their PC unused for more than a few minutes, the screensaver should come on. A password should be entered to exit the screensaver and start work again. You are strongly advised not to bypass this step;
* use a special waste bin or a shredder to destroy sensitive paper documents.
