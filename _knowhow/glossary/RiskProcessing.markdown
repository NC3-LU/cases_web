## In brief
A company that seeks to protect itself will try to deal with any risks ([threat]({% link _knowhow/glossary/Threat.markdown %}) – [vulnerability]({% link _knowhow/glossary/Vulnerabilities.markdown %}) – [impact]({% link _knowhow/glossary/Impact.markdown %})) confronting it. To do this, the company could work along fairly formal lines:

* formal risk management process, catering for the important and vital assets of the company
* the application of best practices for the various types of assets, without carrying out a formal risk analysis
* analysis of the most widespread threats for certain types of assets and the application of appropriate measures
* analysis of the most feared impacts and application of the measures necessary to prevent them
* analysis of the most easily exploitable vulnerabilities and implementation of measures to reduce them

It is still recommended to use a formal risk management strategy. But given that this strategy is fairly complex, a company may well plan to proceed using a less formal method, mainly based on “quick wins” or experience and best practices.

For dealing with risk, a company will usually have the following options:

* lowering risk by applying measures
* avoiding risk by stopping the process in question
* transfer of risk to another entity (outsourcing)
* upholding risk (no treatment is economically desirable)

## Risk management strategy
Risk management is the best way to deal with risks. Without the right tools, this strategy is unfortunately outside the scope of most organisations, for reasons of cost and complexity.

Before setting off on this road to excellence, a lot of companies prefer to opt for a more pragmatic strategy.

## Best practices strategy
A company which has decided not to proceed with the risk management method can achieve a high level of security at any time if it adopts best practices relating to the various types of assets. This strategy, however, is not enough if the company has very specific needs in terms of security.

It could also prove disadvantageous in terms of costs for companies with low security requirements, as it proposes the introduction of best practices without taking into account the true needs of the company.

The adoption of best practices is recommended in the following fields:

* best practices relating to the protection of company data; how to classify data, backups, transfer, transportation and definitive destruction
* best practices relating to the protection of company machines; [computers]({% link _publications/recommendationsecuring/SecuringFixedWorkstation.markdown %}), [laptops]({% link _publications/recommendationsecuring/SecuringLaptops.markdown %}), [file servers]({% link _publications/recommendationsecuring/Recommendations4securingFileServer.markdown %}), [mail servers]({% link _publications/recommendationsecuring/Recommendations4securingEmailServer.markdown %}), [web servers]({% link _publications/recommendationsecuring/Recommendations4securingWebServer.markdown %})
* best practices relating to the protection of networks; [fixed networks]({% link _publications/recommendationsecuring/SecuringFixedNetwork.markdown %}), [wifi networks]({% link _publications/recommendationsecuring/SecuringWifiNetwork.markdown %}), remote working
* [best practices relating to employee and/or client awareness and training]({% link _services/trainings.markdown %})
* [best practices relating to the organisation of security]({% link _knowhow/cisoapproach/SecurityPolicy-OrganisationOfSecurity.markdown %})
* [best practices relating to physical security]({% link _knowhow/cisoapproach/SecurityPolicy-PhysicalAndEnvironmentalSecurity.markdown %})
* [best practices relating to social networks]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/cleverclicks/SocialNetworkScams.markdown %})
* [best practices relating to business trips]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/PracticalGuideForBusinessTrips.markdown %})

The adoption of best practices in the following fields is also advisable:

* best practices: [email]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/EMail-BestPractices.markdown %})
* best practices: [malware]({% link _knowhow/glossary/MaliciousCodes.markdown %})
* best practices: [e-banking, e-commerce]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/OnlineBankingECommerce-BestPractices.markdown %})
* Security [checklist for web applications in PHP]({% link _publications/recommendationsecuring/SecurityChecklistForPHPWebApplications.markdown %})

## Non-exhaustive strategies
To deal with risks, a company may therefore decide to implement a [risk management]({% link _publications/WhyManageRisks.markdown %}) process and implement best practices for the different types of assets.

Alongside these more or less exhaustive strategies, which all focus on the protection of different important and vital assets of the company, each company could start thinking about [threats]({% link _knowhow/glossary/Threat.markdown %}) and [vulnerabilities]({% link _knowhow/glossary/Vulnerabilities.markdown %}). This approach is not exhaustive and should not be deemed to be sufficient, as it does not focus on the important or vital assets of the company.

## Threat analysis
A threat analysis can be treated as an optional approach enabling a more detailed study of certain threats, and ensures that no threat has been overlooked in the risk management strategy or the strategy based on best practices.

See: [Check list of security measures for SMEs]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-CheckList.markdown %})

* Threats to [infrastructure]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Infrastructure.markdown %})
* Threats to [software]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Software.markdown %})
* Threats to [hardware]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2Hardware.markdown %})
* Threats to [human resources]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-Threats2HR.markdown %})
* [Legal aspects]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/SecurityMeasures4SME-LegalAspects.markdown %})

The most widespread threats are:

* [malicious software (malware)]({% link _knowhow/glossary/MaliciousCodes.markdown %})
* [malicious websites]({% link _knowhow/glossary/MaliciousWebsites.markdown %})
* [social engineering]({% link _knowhow/glossary/SocialEngineering.markdown %})
* [phishing]({% link _knowhow/glossary/Phishing.markdown %})
* [theft](-)
* [breakdowns](-)

## Analysis of vulnerabilities

The analysis of [vulnerabilities]({% link _knowhow/glossary/Vulnerabilities.markdown %}) is nothing more than an optional process running alongside the treatment of risks through the implementation of a risk management process or the implementation of best practices.

Without going into too much detail, we can list four types of vulnerabilities that should be addressed. By implementing security measures, we aim to lower these vulnerabilities and therefore reduce risks.

* [Human vulnerabilities]({% link _knowhow/glossary/Vulnerabilities.markdown %}#human-vulnerabilities)<br />
  Fear, curiosity, libido, greed and pity are examples of human vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can be easily exploited on people who are ill-advised or unaware of the issues.

* [Organisational vulnerabilities]({% link _knowhow/glossary/Vulnerabilities.markdown %}#organisational-vulnerabilities)<br />
  Without decent organisation, security measures cannot be effective or efficient. A charter, or even a security policy should be introduced.

* [Technical vulnerabilities]({% link _knowhow/glossary/Vulnerabilities.markdown %}#technical-vulnerabilities)<br />
  There are many technical vulnerabilities. Errors in the operating system, software, missing or erroneous firewall rules, etc. Security measures must be introduced in order to mitigate these technical vulnerabilities.

* [Physical vulnerabilities]({% link _knowhow/glossary/Vulnerabilities.markdown %}#physical-vulnerabilities)<br />
  In terms of physical security, many companies have a lot of weaknesses that it is important to eliminate.
