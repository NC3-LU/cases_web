## In brief

Securing information is far from being a technical issue for an organization. Indeed, technical activities are only one aspect of an approach that, in order to be successful, must cover the activities of the company as a whole.
Before putting in place procedures or technical measures to increase the safety of an organization, it is important to carry out a risk analysis ([risk management]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/RiskManagement.markdown %})) and write a security policy.

The security policy is used to formalize and coordinate all organizational and technical security procedures of the organization.
Writing a security policy is a tedious task. We do not advise small businesses to approach them, and instead recommend moving forward with a view to continuous improvement, a short and concise document at a time, to gradually develop the sectoral procedures and policies that they have in place. Not needed anymore.

The common thread for the development of a security policy consists of one side in a set of good practices ([ISO / IEC 27001]({% link _publications/ISO27000SF/ISO27001-ISMS.markdown %}) and [ISO / IEC 27002]({% link _publications/ISO27000SF/ISO27002-CodeBestPractices4ISM.markdown %})), and the other in the analysis and [risk assessment]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/RiskManagement.markdown %}#risk-estimation). Indeed, any organization must ensure that behavioral, organizational and technical measures are put in place where they will be quickly and truly effective.

In any case, it is advisable to choose an approach adapted to the [criticality]({% link _knowhow/cisoapproach/SecurityPolicy-Classification.markdown %}) size of the [assets]({% link _knowhow/glossary/Assets.markdown %}) and the maturity of the organization.

## Security Charter

Defining and enforcing a [security policy]({% link _knowhow/cisoapproach/SecurityPolicy-SecurityPolicy.markdown %}) is the first step toward managing security. To ensure its success, it must meet the specific security needs of the organization. A [risk analysis]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/RiskManagement.markdown %}), even a summary, must necessarily precede this process. Without this analysis, management will not be able to understand which [assets]({% link _knowhow/glossary/Assets.markdown %}) to protect in priority. In order to prevent the most dreaded [impacts]({% link _knowhow/glossary/Impact.markdown %}), management needs to identify the most important [threats]({% link _knowhow/glossary/Threat.markdown %}) as well as the [vulnerabilities]({% link _knowhow/glossary/Vulnerabilities.markdown %}) that are most easily exploited.

The implementation of a charter must be accompanied by a presentation to employees who will live with the measures proposed daily. Without training on their part, any charter risks being ignored, and thus losing its usefulness.

## Security policy

After the identification of the major risks for the organization ([risk management]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/RiskManagement.markdown %})), the management can, with a view to continuous improvement, go beyond 'a simple security charter. It will put in place a real policy as well as specific procedures.

The implementation of a security policy, even rudimentary, will allow management to begin the organization of security. It will be defined in formal procedures, the obligations and responsibilities of each, as well as processes related to the security of information.

It is not necessary at this stage to start with the implementation of a comprehensive security policy. Safeguarding an organization is an ongoing process (Design, Implementation, Evaluation / Control and Improvement), implemented on the basis of [security measures]({% link _publications/ProtectingYourCompany.markdown %}), evaluated in [Impact]({% link _knowhow/glossary/Impact.markdown %}) the most feared, [threats]({% link _knowhow/glossary/Threat.markdown %}) the most likely and [vulnerabilities]({% link _knowhow/glossary/Vulnerabilities.markdown %}) the most important.

### Design

This first step aims to correctly define the scope and context of the future system. It must also make it possible to identify and evaluate risks in order to develop a management plan. (It can not, however, replace [the risk analysis]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/RiskManagement.markdown %}) that must be done beforehand.

The realization step consists mainly of applying the security policy created in the previous step. Organizational and technical measures are put in place, behavioral measures are applied by staff.

### Evaluation and control

The evaluation systems must have been described in the safety manual. The goal is to ensure that the procedures put in place work as intended.
These evaluations can be of several types:

* regular audits done as part of daily activities;
* Automatic controls performed with software tools to create reports;
* comparison with other organizations;
* carrying out planned formal audits ("risk assessment");
* revision by the management.

If evaluations and controls reveal inadequacies in certain procedures, corrections must be made.

### Improvement

The actions that will have been decided in the previous step will have to be implemented, ie:

* at the level of the security system itself, as for example by appointing a (new) person responsible for all or part of the system;
* at the level of the operational procedures which will have been deduced, for example by the implementation of a different data backup procedure (and obviously more adapted);
* at the tools level, such as the purchase of an [antivirus]({% link _knowhow/glossary/AntiVirus.markdown %}) tool.
