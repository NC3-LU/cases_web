## In Brief
It is strongly inadvisable to lend a LuxTrust card to a third party. Users cannot only be [authenticated]({% link _knowhow/glossary/Authentication.markdown %}) by using this card, but they can also sign documents.

Depending on the type of card, signatures can be personal or on behalf of the organisation (professional card).

Lending someone a LuxTrust card is the equivalent of giving a third party an absolute power of signature, with no restrictions.

For organisational reasons, the entity should hold 'spare' cards intended for users who have accidentally left theirs at home. These cards only work within the entity, and are only allocated for one day to enable in-house authentication.
