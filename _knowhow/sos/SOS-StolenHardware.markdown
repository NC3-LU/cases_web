* **Step 1**: If the device has access to your accounts (email, social media), please remove this authentication from all your accounts. All you have to do is log in to your accounts online and change the authentications.
* **Step 2**: Change the passwords for all the accounts that can be accessed by the device.
* **Step 3**: Activate dual authentication for the accounts that can be accessed by the device. Please note that all accounts have dual authentication.
* **Step 4**: If you installed a tool capable of deleting data and the history, use it.
