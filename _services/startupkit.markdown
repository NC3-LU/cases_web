The [Start-up Security Kit](http://startup.cases.lu/fr/), developed by CASES experts, is an online tool to help business owners implement a better cybersecurity strategy.Â 

The tool operates at 3 levels (START, FIT and TOP) and covers four categories of protection measures:

* the right reflexes;
* hardware protection;
* data protection;
* the organisation.
