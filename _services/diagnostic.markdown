## Why?
Your organisation deals with sensitive data every day. As a data manager, you have specific obligations in relation to data protection. The CASES diagnostic will help you reduce your exposure to IT risks.


## How?
Using a dedicated questionnaire, CASES's experts will:

* **identify** vulnerabilities
* **evaluate** the level of maturity of the security of your IT systems
* **issue** recommendations

The diagnostic can help to:

* **ensure** the security of internal data and information about customers
* **ensure** that the business complies with the laws of Luxembourg
* **protect** the company's reputation

The diagnostic will help you in both technical and organisational terms. The questions are devised to cover the most frequent information risks in Luxembourg.
A CASES expert will visit your company and will ask you the necessary questions, while providing you with guidance. This is a good introduction to the information security continuous improvement procedure.
