## Why?

The processing of sensitive information and personal data is crucial, not only for the degree of trust that your customers place in your services, but also for the sustainability of your business.

CASES has developed an analysis method to produce a comprehensive risk report on this matter, with suggested solutions. You will therefore be able to take the appropriate measures to enhance information security within your organisation and meet your legal obligations.

## How?
CASES optimised risk analysis method (MONARC):

* thoroughly **evaluates** the risks involved
* **determines** their level of criticality
* **describes** the possible consequences for your organisation
 
It is based on CASES expertise and regularly updated prior knowledge of the business processes used within your professional organisation.

#### Stage 1: Context Establishment
This stage is used to set establish the context of the risk analysis and to produce:

* a trend evaluation
* a [threats]({% link _knowhow/glossary/Threat.markdown %}) assessment
* the risk management context
* definition of the assessment, acceptance and impact criteria

#### Stage 2: Context Modelling
This step involves

* identification of assets, vulnerabilities
* impact assessment
* summary of assets/impacts

#### Stage 3: Evaluation and treatment of risks
This step involves the estimation, evaluation and processing of risks. Its output is a risk management plan.

#### Stage 4: Implementation and monitoring
This involves the implementation of the risk treatment plan.
