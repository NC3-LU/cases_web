New technologies allow employees to work remotely; from home or on a business trip. Teleworking is a growing habit thanks to the increased use of mobile devices such as tablets, mobile phones and laptops, as well as cloud storage in the professional environment.

## The human being stays the weakest link... especially abroad

One of the most important aspects to consider is the connection itself. Employees should not connect to free Wi-Fi, especially in train stations and airports. These networks are too often used by attackers to disseminate malicious software, targeting organisations or companies through their employees.

No matter where you are outside the company, it is important to use a Virtual Private Network, also called [VPN]({% link _knowhow/glossary/VPN.markdown %}). This tool allows the user to create a direct and secure connection between the device and the company’s internal network, essentially imitating the computer being plugged in the company's network; the data received and sent by the employee is thus protected and access to internal resources can be granted.

The software used to provide the VPN service must be chosen with the utmost care and it must be kept up-to-date and configured carefully. The clients should be authenticated by using asymmetric encryption and not only a login and a password when connecting to the VPN. Prefer to use a well known, ideally open-source, easily auditable solution, for example, [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com). More information about VPN and how to use it can be found on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41mgTiRNjQE).

## Devices must be prepared in advance

As always, the endpoints remain the major weak points. The best VPN service is useless if an employee connects to it with an infected computer. Computers of employees must be protected with an up-to-date antivirus. Otherwise, the VPN would be an illusion of security, and would become a secure and trusted channel for ransomware for example...

Before any teleworking of an employee, the IT team (or the person in charge of the security) has to set up the device correctly. The following tasks have to be done:

  * Each hard drive that contains confidential data should be encrypted whenever it goes outside the company; *ideally, it would be permanently encrypted if there is a possibility it leaves the company’s premises at some point in time*.
  * Provide a specific “[travel laptop]({% link _knowhow/bestpractices/PracticalGuideForBusinessTrips.markdown %}#before-the-trip)” for business trips with minimal configuration, files, access and maximal protection possible.

## Communication and training are the keys

The interest of teleworking relies on the capacity of employees to accomplish their tasks while not being at their desks. It might be reassuring for the management to set a detailed security policy with high-security requirements. However, it is more efficient to focus on basic and well-understood rules by the employees; they have to also understand the reasons of a security measure and the consequences of cyberattacks. To achieve this, the employees have to be [trained]({% link _services/trainings.markdown %}) often in-house or externally by information security professionals.

Additionally, some rules must be set and respected by everyone. Here are some examples:

  * Adapt the security level to each employee's requirement. Discussions about confidential data should be limited to conversation partners that also have access to that same data, and no one else.
  * Warn employees to be very cautious about who could see their device's screen, not to display confidential data in public (like database information, contracts or sensitive emails).
  * If the laptop is unused, the session must be locked.
  * Do not connect to any public, unknown, or unchecked networks. Creating a [fake Wi-Fi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUiBEv-cM0) and thus deceiving someone is relatively easy.
  * Use the roaming from your phone to have a more secure network and use a VPN.
  * Define responsibilities and rules, so in case a material is stolen or forgotten, it can be assured that the employee notifies their security contact quickly.
  * Everyone has to know that devices must never be left unattended. Anti-theft cables can also be used to decrease that risk.
  * Remote access software (like Teamviewer) should be used very carefully and only by authorized employees. It has to be always updated, and only used in case of absolute necessity. -> *Precisely: by letting it run constantly to access the computer anytime brings similar risks than opening a backdoor.*

As the teleworking practice grows, it is important to give necessary guidelines for employees. Most of the security problems come from employees who have not been trained enough or do not understand the consequences of their behaviour. It is also possible to minimize the threat of non-compliance by involving employees during the process of creating information security rules and guidelines.

## CASES Expert Voice

“Teleworking begins to gain popularity with connections becoming increasingly better. Most companies are mature enough to have a VPN to protect their data and communication. However, most companies only concentrate on technical matters and forget that the human factor is the weakest link in the security chain. The rules and guidelines should be clearly defined, understood, and signed. Besides, explanation of consequences should be given and employees should be properly prepared for the usage of technology.”
