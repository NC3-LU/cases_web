## Luxembourgish landscape in information security threat through years (from Diagnostic CASES)

### A Bit of Background History

The “unpleasant yield” of the evolution of technology and information systems is the increase of cyber-attacks and intensified risks and threats we should face. Such threats have been present since the dawn of information technology, yet their nature and ability to cause harm was different. Today’s cyberattacks are more sophisticated and destructive than ever before.

### Methods used in the Study

This study summarizes the results of 149 CASES Diagnostics, which have been carried out between 06/2016 and 12/2019. During this period, 774 recommendations were given and 434 of them were considered as urgent to implement, which represents approximately 2.91 urgent recommendations per diagnostic. Throughout the diagnostics, 4768 questions were asked, and only 452 of them were answered which shows that the subject is not well-known.

### Explanation of used metrics

* __Success percentage__: 	an optimised answer counts as 1 success, whereas a basic answer counts as 0.5.
* __Dangerousness indicator__: 	a fail of answering a question combined with a CASES coefficient used for questions in the CASES Diagnostic.
* __Recommendation percentage__: the percentage of recommendations given

### The top 10 danger factors in the last years

Over the past years, CASES has been collected a vast amount of data on the most important risk factors in startups and SMEs. During such quick assessments, many different categories have been discussed and assessed. The below table shows the top 10 danger factors identified by the CASES Diagnostic during the past couple of years:

**Table 1** - *The Top 10 Dangerousness Indicators found by CASES Diagnostic*

“Password creation and management” includes length and type of passwords, whereas “Wireless networks” comprise configuration related matters besides password management. “Backup management” involves backup periodicity, location, and restoration of backups. We refer to “Non-Divulgation Agreement” on confidentiality clauses in contracts, while “BYOD” means the accepted practice when employees are allowed to use their own device/s for professional work at their workplace or when working from home.

### Evolution of 3 important factors between 2016 and 2019

The below table shows the “Dangerousness Indicator” figures in the percentage of the top 3 factors between 2016 and 2019. The numbers are very “communicative”, especially to the factor of password creation and management. It is very contemplative though that password-related threats are highly the most serious ones according to the CASES Diagnostic.

**Table 2** - *Evolution of important factors throughout 2016-19*

The below line graph shows the above figures in a visual manner. The horizontal axis represents the period of 2016-2019, whereas the vertical axis shows the values of the top 3 cybersecurity threats in percentages of the Dangerousness Indicator.

**Line Graph 1** - *The changes in the top 3 threats over a 4-year period from 2016 to 2019*

“Password creation and management” has always had the highest values, starting at 87.12% in 2016, dropping a bit to 75.40% in 2017, but growing in 2018 and culminating in 2019 with a threatening 95.53%.

The values of “Backups management” have been significantly lower, with the percentages of 68.18, 75.40, 65.59 and 57.19 for the years of 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Although there was a peak in 2017, there has been a slight decrease in the forthcoming two years. Hopefully, this trend will continue in the future as well.

The threat related to personal data (GDPR) is a recent phenomenon, and as such, it should be treated with the utmost attention. The value of its dangerousness indicator was the lowest in 2017 (with a percentage of 28.57%). On the other hand, its trend is somewhat opposite of the one called “Backup management”. Unfortunately, it nearly doubled in 2018 (51.28%), and continued growing in 2019 (58.54%).

### How can CASES help?

CASES (Cybersecurity Awareness and Security Enhancement Services) has multiple services available to the public. The goal is to give every organisation the necessary tools and information to define their risk maturity and improve it.

1.	**[Fit4Cybersecurity]({% link _services/Fit4Cybersecurity.markdown %})**: a self-assessment tool, to help business owners implement a better cybersecurity strategy. The objective of this free online survey is to assess the maturity of an organization in terms of applicable good practices in the field of information security. It is also a prerequisite for doing Diagnostic CASES: a minimum score of 80/100 is required.

2.	**[CASES Diagnostic]({% link _services/diagnostic.markdown %})**: a CASES expert visits your organization (in Luxembourg) and presents a 2-hour-long survey. The expert will identify vulnerabilities, evaluate the level of maturity of the security of your IT infrastructure, and will issue recommendations. A Fit4Cybersecurity is mandatory before accessing our service.

3.	**[Monarc]({% link _services/monarc.markdown %})** (Optimised Risk Analysis Method): a tool and method, allowing optimised, precise, and repeatable risk assessment. Monarc is a software application, which has been and is being developed by CASES. By using Monarc, you become competent to take appropriate measures to enhance information security within your organisation and meet your legal obligations.

4.	**[Training]({% link _services/trainings.markdown %})**: proper cybersecurity needs the foundation of good teamwork. CASES training provides the knowledge and reflexes that your team requires. It is fully adapted to your specific situation and encourages your staff to communicate better and follow the reflexes to fight against cyber threats more effectively.
