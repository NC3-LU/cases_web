Hi! If you have landed on this page, it’s because you have very probably found a “virtually stolen” sticker on your computer screen, mobile phone or tablet. Well done! You’ve dodged a bullet! A dishonest person would have been able to steal your electronic device in the blink of an eye. So for CASES, the aim was to remind you about a few pieces of advice relating to the protection of your IT equipment and data security:

1. Remember that the loss of a piece of equipment is not limited to the physical loss of property. Alongside that there is all the data, and sometimes the reputation of the person or company concerned may be at risk. Find out about the impacts of physical theft.
2. Sensitive data can easily be lost, stolen or destroyed during business trips. Once on the road or in the air, it is important to keep an eye on your equipment and be aware of the risks incurred. “Be safe” tells you about the traps to be avoided.
3. It’s so liberating to be able to work on a laptop! Not only can laptops be transported outside the company, but they can also plug in to other networks, some of them with little in the way of protection. Take your own security measures!
4. “Bring Your Own Device”, BYOD: an increasing number of employees bring their own devices to work and connect to the company network. This provides benefits in terms of productivity, but pay attention to the risks in terms of IT security! To take advantage of the benefits brought by BYOD, companies should include it in their IT strategy and in their security policy. Read our article about this topic.
